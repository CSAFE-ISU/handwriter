get_centroid_info(character, dims)

\item{character}{character to extract information from}

}
\value{
List containing centroid, pixel density,letter 'lean', and all supporting information
}
\description{
Extracts centroid & supporting information from a character
Relevant Features:
Centroid Index: R Index representation of centroid location
Centroid x,y: X,Y representations of the centroid, see ?i_to_rci 
Centroid Horiz Location: How far along horizontally (Represented as a number between 0 and 1) the centroid is in its respective character.
Centroid Vertical Location: How far along vertically (Represented as a number between 0 and 1) the centroid is in its respective character.
Slope: 'Letter Lean', slope found between the centroids of each disjoint half in a single character.
The letter is split in half, each halve's centroid is calculated independently, the slope is taken between the two. 
Box Density: (Dimensions of box around letter width height) / (how much of the document it covers) //Might be a more document as opposed to letter based feature
Pixel Density: Ratio of black to white pixels found in box drawn around the letter.
